# People Who throw Stones
This is my entry in the raylib slo-jam.  A 4 week long gamejam using raylib targeting web builds via emscripten.  

## Building
Enter the `src` directory and then run `make index.html` to build a WASM version of the program. The files will end up in `./src/build/`.

The contents of the `./src/resources` directory are automatically packed up and bundled with the WASM build.
